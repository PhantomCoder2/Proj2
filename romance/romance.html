                            with her grandfather, but due to his home being renovated, is unable to continue living with
                            him. Claiming she will find someone to stay with but also fearing the criticism of her family
                            and not wanting to burden any of her friends, Tooru resorts to secretly living on her own in a
                            tent in the woods.
                             <br>
                            One night on her way back from work, she finds her tent buried underneath a landslide. Yuki
                            Souma, the "prince" of her school, and his cousin Shigure Souma, a famous author, stumble 
                            across Tooru's situation and invite her to stay with them until her grandfather’s home
                            renovations are complete.
                            <br>
                            Upon arriving at the Souma house, Tooru discovers their secret: if a Souma is hugged by someone
                            of the opposite gender, they temporarily transform into one of the animals of the zodiac! 
                            However, this strange phenomenon is no laughing matter; rather, it is a terrible curse that 
                            holds a dark history. As she continues her journey, meeting more members of the zodiac family,
                            will Tooru's kindhearted yet resilient nature be enough to prepare her for what lies behind 
                            the Souma household's doors?</p>

                            to an intimidating yakuza family. Ten years ago, Raku made a promise to his childhood friend.
                            Now, all he has to go on is a pendant with a lock, which can only be unlocked with the key 
                            which the girl took with her when they parted.

                            Now, years later, Raku has grown into a typical teenager, and all he wants is to remain as

                            family's turf, Raku's idyllic romantic dreams are sent for a toss as he is dragged into a 
                            frustrating conflict: Raku is to pretend that he is in a romantic relationship with Chitoge 
                            Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's chief, so as to reduce the friction
                            between the two groups. Unfortunately, reality could not be farther from this whopping
                            lie—Raku and Chitoge fall in hate at first sight, as the girl is convinced he is a pathetic
                            pushover, and in Raku's eyes, Chitoge is about as attractive as a savage gorilla.

                           However, Tomoya finds he is noticing Nagisa more and more around school. Eventually he concedes and
                           befriends her. Tomoya learns Nagisa has been held back a year due to a severe illness and that her
                           dream is to revive the school's drama club. Claiming he has nothing better to do, he decides to help 
                           her achieve this goal along with the help of four other girls.

                           As Tomoya spends more time with the girls, he learns more about them and their problems. As he attempts 
                           to help each girl overcome her respective obstacle, he begins to realize life isn't as dull as he once
                           thought.</p>

                         <p class="card-text">  Music accompanies the path of the human metronome, the prodigious pianist
                            Kousei Arima. But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls into a downward
                             spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.
                            <br>
                           Two years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and
                            lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari. However, 
                            everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his 
                            world and sets him on a journey to face music again.
                           <br>
                           Based on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the story 
                           of Kousei's recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, 
                           and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.</p>
