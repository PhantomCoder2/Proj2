                    with her grandfather, but due to his home being renovated, is unable to continue living with
                    him. Claiming she will find someone to stay with but also fearing the criticism of her family
                    and not wanting to burden any of her friends, Tooru resorts to secretly living on her own in a
                    tent in the woods.
                     <br>

                    across Tooru's situation and invite her to stay with them until her grandfather’s home

                    <br>
                    Upon arriving at the Souma house, Tooru discovers their secret: if a Souma is hugged by someone
                    of the opposite gender, they temporarily transform into one of the animals of the zodiac! 
                    However, this strange phenomenon is no laughing matter; rather, it is a terrible curse that 
                    holds a dark history. As she continues her journey, meeting more members of the zodiac family,
                    will Tooru's kindhearted yet resilient nature be enough to prepare her for what lies behind

                 <p><b>The Story:</b> Raku Ichijou, a first-year student at Bonyari High School, is the sole heir
                    to an intimidating yakuza family. Ten years ago, Raku made a promise to his childhood friend.
                    Now, all he has to go on is a pendant with a lock, which can only be unlocked with the key 
                    which the girl took with her when they parted.
                    <br>
                    Now, years later, Raku has grown into a typical teenager, and all he wants is to remain as
                    uninvolved in his yakuza background as possible while spending his school days alongside 
                    his middle school crush Kosaki Onodera. However, when the American Bee Hive Gang invades his 
                    family's turf, Raku's idyllic romantic dreams are sent for a toss as he is dragged into a 
                    frustrating conflict: Raku is to pretend that he is in a romantic relationship with Chitoge 
                    Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's chief, so as to reduce the friction
                    between the two groups. Unfortunately, reality could not be farther from this whopping
                    lie—Raku and Chitoge fall in hate at first sight, as the girl is convinced he is a pathetic
                    pushover, and in Raku's eyes, Chitoge is about as attractive as a savage gorilla.
