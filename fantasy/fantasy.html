                         <p class="card-text">Academy City, Japan, is at the forefront of science. Besides being 30 years
                            ahead of the world technologically, more than three-fourths of this peculiar city's population
                             consists of students developing their psychic abilities as espers in various institutions. 
                             Among these students is Touma Kamijou, a high school boy with the lowest psychic rank of zero,
                              but with a mysterious power no scientist can understand: "Imagine Breaker," which allows him 
                              to negate other supernatural abilities.
                            <br><br>
                           This, however, doesn't affect Kamijou's life in the least as he plays his role as a
                           regular teenager; that is, until he meets the strange Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a
                           young girl who has memorized the entirety of the forbidden grimoires, and now a dangerous
                           organization is hunting Index down. With several magicians looking to harm the girl, Kamijou
                           will defend his new companion at all costs as he discovers a strange new realm of the supernatural.</p>

                         <p class="card-text"> Mirai Kuriyama is the sole survivor of a clan of Spirit World warriors with the power to employ
                            their blood as weapons. As such, Mirai is tasked with hunting down and killing "youmu"—creatures said to be
                             the manifestation of negative human emotions. One day, while deep in thought on the school roof, Mirai
                              comes across Akihito Kanbara, a rare half-breed of youmu in human form. In a panicked state, she plunges
                               her blood saber into him only to realize that he's an immortal being. From then on, the two form an
                                impromptu friendship that revolves around Mirai constantly trying to kill Akihito, in an effort to
                                 boost her own wavering confidence as a Spirit World warrior. Eventually, Akihito also manages to
                                  convince her to join the Literary Club, which houses two other powerful Spirit World warriors,
                                   Hiroomi and Mitsuki Nase.
                           <br><br>
                           As the group's bond strengthens, however, so does the tenacity of the youmu around them. Their 
                           misadventures will soon turn into a fight for survival as the inevitable release of the most powerful
                            youmu, Beyond the Boundary, approaches. </p>

                             for five seconds at a time. Yuu has been using this skill for years to gain the highest grades, which

                            wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things aren't looking good for the
                            bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with
                            only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately,
                            a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens 
                            upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to 
                            help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks.
                            But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes 
                            after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.

                            the real world as just another lousy game; however, a strange e-mail challenging them to

                            games. This system works thanks to a fundamental rule wherein each party must wager something they
                             deem to be of equal value to the other party's wager. In this strange land where the very idea of
                              humanity is reduced to child's play, the indifferent genius gamer duo of Sora and Shiro have 
                              finally found a real reason to keep playing games: to unite the sixteen races of Disboard, defeat
                               Tet, and become the gods of this new, gaming-is-everything world.</p>

                            makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger
                             but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began
                              living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.
                               However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly 
                               impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

                              and benevolent leader, the rest of the nation is left to drown in poverty, strife, and
                               ruin. Though the Night Raid members are all experienced killers, they understand that
                                taking lives is far from commendable and that they will likely face retribution as they
                                 mercilessly eliminate anyone who stands in the revolution's way.
       
                           This merry band of assassins' newest member is Tatsumi, a naïve boy from a remote village
                            who had embarked on a journey to help his impoverished hometown and was won over by not 
                            only Night Raid's ideals, but also their resolve. Akame ga Kill! follows Tatsumi as he 
                            fights the Empire and comes face-to-face with powerful weapons, enemy assassins, challenges
                             to his own morals and values, and ultimately, what it truly means to be an assassin with a cause. </p>

                         <p class="card-text"> In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and 
                            a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid 
                            of "NerveGear" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing
                             but their own thoughts.
                            <br><br>
                            Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands
                             on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in
                              the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and 
                              gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they 
                              cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete
                               all one hundred levels of the game.
                            <br><br>
                            In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow 
                            players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading 
                            group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online
                             is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt
                              to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.</p>
