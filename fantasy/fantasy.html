                     ahead of the world technologically, more than three-fourths of this peculiar city's population
                      consists of students developing their psychic abilities as espers in various institutions. 
                      Among these students is Touma Kamijou, a high school boy with the lowest psychic rank of zero,
                       but with a mysterious power no scientist can understand: "Imagine Breaker," which allows him 
                       to negate other supernatural abilities.
                     <br><br>
                    This, however, doesn't affect Kamijou's life in the least as he plays his role as a
                    regular teenager; that is, until he meets the strange Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a
                    young girl who has memorized the entirety of the forbidden grimoires, and now a dangerous
                    organization is hunting Index down. With several magicians looking to harm the girl, Kamijou
                    will defend his new companion at all costs as he discovers a strange new realm of the supernatural.</p>

                    wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things aren't looking good for the
                    bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with
                    only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately,
                    a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens

                     games. This system works thanks to a fundamental rule wherein each party must wager something they

                       humanity is reduced to child's play, the indifferent genius gamer duo of Sora and Shiro have 
                       finally found a real reason to keep playing games: to unite the sixteen races of Disboard, defeat
                        Tet, and become the gods of this new, gaming-is-everything world.

                <p><b>The Story:</b> Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid 
                    creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What 
                    makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger
                     but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began
                      living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.
                       However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly 
                       impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

                      the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning
                       manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood
                        friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of

                <p><b>The Story:</b>Night Raid is the covert assassination branch of the Revolutionary Army,
                     an uprising assembled to overthrow Prime Minister Honest, whose avarice and greed for
                      power has led him to take advantage of the child emperor's inexperience. Without a strong
                       and benevolent leader, the rest of the nation is left to drown in poverty, strife, and
                        ruin. Though the Night Raid members are all experienced killers, they understand that
                         taking lives is far from commendable and that they will likely face retribution as they
                          mercilessly eliminate anyone who stands in the revolution's way.

                    This merry band of assassins' newest member is Tatsumi, a naïve boy from a remote village
                     who had embarked on a journey to help his impoverished hometown and was won over by not 
                     only Night Raid's ideals, but also their resolve. Akame ga Kill! follows Tatsumi as he 
                     fights the Empire and comes face-to-face with powerful weapons, enemy assassins, challenges
                      to his own morals and values, and ultimately, what it truly means to be an assassin with a cause.

                    a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid 
                    of "NerveGear" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing
                     but their own thoughts.
                    <br><br>
                    Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands
                     on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in
                      the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and 
                      gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they 
                      cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete
                       all one hundred levels of the game.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow 
                    players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading 
                    group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online
                     is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt
                      to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.
