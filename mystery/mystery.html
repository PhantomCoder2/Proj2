                    and oblivion. There the attendant will, one after another, challenge pairs of the recently deceased to
                    a random game in which their fate of either ascending into reincarnation or falling into the void will
                    be wagered. Whether it's bowling, darts, air hockey, or anything in between, each person's true nature
                    will be revealed in a ghastly parade of death and memories, dancing to the whims of the bar's master.

                    Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of 
                    each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their 
                    Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone 
                    harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have
                    become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the
                    Inspectors' dirty work.

                    Into this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold 
                    justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns
                    that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. 
                    With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of 
                    what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may 
                    already be corrupt.</p>

                    constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest
                    threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.
