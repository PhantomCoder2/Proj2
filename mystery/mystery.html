                            a random game in which their fate of either ascending into reincarnation or falling into the void will
                            be wagered. Whether it's bowling, darts, air hockey, or anything in between, each person's true nature
                            will be revealed in a ghastly parade of death and memories, dancing to the whims of the bar's master.

                            Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of 
                            each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their 
                            Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone 
                            harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have
                            become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the
                            Inspectors' dirty work.

                            justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns
                            that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. 
                            With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of 
                            what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may 
                            already be corrupt.</p>

                           Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe 
                           through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of
                            past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of
                             time.</p>

                         <p class="card-text"> In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student named Light Yagami 
                            finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user 
                            knows both the target's name and face. After verifying that the notebook works and initially being
                            terrified of its god-like abilities, Light begins to consider the possibilities of the 
                            Death Note's abilities and sets out to create a utopian world without crime, killing numerous
                            high-profile Japanese criminals, before eventually targeting international criminals and felons 
                            around the world.</p>
